Question 1 ) what is your understanding of Blockchain?

Ans --> Blockchain is a mix of technology  - Distributed database and cryptography
where information  is verificable , unchangable , tampor-proof and immutable
Blockchain is introduced due to "International banking crisis with the collapse
of investment in 2008" .
A blockchain is essentially a digital ledger of transactions that is duplicated 
and distributed across the entire network of computer systems on the blockchain.

Question 2 ) What is a core problem Blockchain trying to solve ?

Ans --> 1)Currency and Transaction Support
	2)Supply Chains and Item Histories
	3)Voting
	4)Government Operations
	5)Intellectual Property
	6)Cloud Storage
	7)Charity

Question 3) What are the features which blockchain will give you ?

Ans --> 1)Enhanced Security
	2)Faster Settlement 
	3)Distributed Ledgers
	4)Decentralized Technology
	5)Cannot be Corrupted

Question 4) What all things does a Block contain?

Ans --> Each block contains, among other things, the current time, a record of 
some or all recent transactions, and a reference to the block that came 
immediately before it. It also contains an answer to a difficult-to-solve 
mathematical puzzle - the answer to which is unique to each block.
A block contains the hash value of pervious page and date of its own. First
block didn't have hash value of previous page thats why its called "Genesis block".
Large numbers of blocks are connected to each other.

Question 5) How is the  verifiability of Blockchain has been attended ?

Ans --> Validate transactions are stored into a block and are sealt with a hash. this
block become a part of the blockchain when other computers in the network validate
if the hash on the block is correct. Now the transactions is part of the blockchain
and cannot be altered any way.
